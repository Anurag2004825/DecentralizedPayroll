
Project Title:Decentralized Payroll System

Project Description
A blockchain-based decentralized payroll system built on the Stellar network using Soroban smart contracts. This system enables companies to manage employee records and process salary payments in a transparent, secure, and automated manner. The smart contract ensures that all payroll transactions are recorded on-chain, providing immutability and transparency while maintaining administrative control through role-based access.
The system allows administrators to register employees with their wallet addresses and salary details, process monthly/periodic payments, and maintain a complete audit trail of all payroll transactions. Employees can verify their registration and payment history directly on the blockchain.
Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize traditional payroll systems by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and trustless payment infrastructure. We aim to:

Eliminate intermediaries: Remove the need for traditional banking systems and payment processors, reducing transaction costs and processing time
Ensure transparency: Make all payroll transactions verifiable and auditable on the blockchain
Guarantee security: Utilize smart contract technology to ensure payments are processed accurately and on time
Enable global accessibility: Allow companies to pay employees worldwide without currency conversion complexities
Build trust: Create an immutable record of all employment and payment data that both employers and employees can trust
Promote financial inclusion: Enable employees without traditional bank accounts to receive payments through crypto wallets
